## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Collaborating with both a web designer and a local artist, we brought to life this website utilizing the technologies above to create a dynamtic webpage that showcases true responsiveness beauty while exhibiting the beauty of the artists' work. Building the page with HTML, styling it with CSS and making it interactive using JavaScript set the foundation for the final product.

## Lessons Learned:

I was able to set up a few media queries for the device to render with a improved user-experience since the mobile version of the site looked a bit different than the desktop version. This lesson provided me with the lesson to quality check all types of screen sizes as media is consumed in various different forms.
